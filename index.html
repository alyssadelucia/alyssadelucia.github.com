<p>I was born and raised on Floridaâ€™s Treasure Coast. In high school, chemistry piqued my interest as I saw it as a way to better understand the world around me. I attended Rollins College and continued to explore my interest in chemistry, interning at Moffitt Cancer Center and Georgia Tech. I conducted research under the supervision of Dr. Laurel Habgood and authored and defended a thesis. In 2018, I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Rollins College with a BA in Chemistry and with Honors.</p>

<p>I attended graduate school at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and graduated with my PhD in Chemistry from the <a target="_blank" href="https://olshanskylab.squarespace.com">Olshansky group</a> in 2023. My doctoral work focused on synthesizing and characterizing dinuclear cobalt complexes that serve as structural models for the active sites of metallo-oxidoreductases. I am trained on a variety of spectroscopic methods and inorganic synthetic techniques. Please see my resume, CV, and research section of my website for more details.</p>

<p>Besides my research, I am passionate about mentoring younger scientists and fostering an inclusive environment. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading romantasy novels, watching K-dramas, lounging at beaches, dancing, hiking, and knitting.</p>
