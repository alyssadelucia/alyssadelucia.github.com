<p>I am a Chemistry PhD candidate in the <a target="_blank" href="https://olshanskylab.squarespace.com">Olshansky group</a> at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My thesis research focuses on synthesizing and characterizing dinuclear cobalt complexes that serve as structural models for the active sites of oxidase metalloenzymes. I am trained on a variety of spectroscopic methods and inorganic synthetic techniques.</p>

<p>I have a BA in Chemistry from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rollins.edu/chemistry/">Rollins College</a>, and my thesis advisor was Laura Habgood.</p>

<br>

<p>Besides my research, I am passionate about mentoring younger scientists and fostering an inclusive environment. In my free time, I enjoy cooking and baking, reading terrible romance novels, lounging at beaches, dancing, hiking, and knitting.</p>
