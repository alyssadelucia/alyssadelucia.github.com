### Miscellaneous Mentions
In 2017 I was a Goldwater scholar finalist. This was covered by my undergraduate college magazine [Rollins360](https://wayback.archive-it.org/4097/20210409211523/https://360.rollins.edu/academics-and-research/delucia-earns-goldwater-scholarship).

A Rollins College [*Sandspur* article](http://www.thesandspur.org/delucia-twins-organize-march-science/) about my role organizing Rollins' participation in Orlando's March for Science 2017.
